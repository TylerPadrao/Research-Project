    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      COVID has impacted the entire world. Almost 70% of Americans during the
      height of COVID were working from home. Although remote working has been
      on the rise before the pandemic, it has increased substantially. Even when
      stay at home orders are relaxed, many workers may continue to work
      remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does working from home impact the worker? Evidence has shown both
      positive and negative effects on emotional and physical wellbeing. Things
      to consider when working from home are work life balance, productivity,
      flexibility, and collaboration. Additionally, COVID has changed the IT
      strategy and has transformed businesses. Executives recognize advanced
      technologies as a critical component of a business. COVID has impacted the
      electronic supply chain, security, and remote communication technologies.
      COVID has also had an impact on the workerâ€™s communication and
      collaboration. Working from home raises the importance of employee
      engagement, trust, and collaboration.
