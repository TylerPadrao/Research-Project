        The COVID-19 impact on the remote worker has had both positive and
        negative effects on emotional and physical well-being

      <h1>Work Life Balance</h1>

      <p>
        Employees are craving for help with work-life balance as they are
        working longer hours and are having a difficult time unplugging. It can
        result in a fusion of work and private life and some employees have a
        difficult time disengaging at the end of the day. Employers need to
        respect the private lives of their employees when they are away from
        their source of communication. Finding this balanced lifestyle will
        ensure an important balance of mental and physical health as well as
        maximize productivity (Eck & Belgium, 2020).

      <p>
        Nearly 1/3 of newly remote workers struggle to stay productive. Many
        types of distractions from home such as kids, pets, and outside noise
        can cause this unproductivity. In a work environment, these distractions
        do not occur. Lack of feeling productive can lead to stress and poor
        mental health (Hanson, 2020).

      <p>
        Some employees are having a difficult time collaborating with their
        peers. To combat this, companies are creatively planning off-time
        moments such as virtual coffee sessions, luncheons, or bring your kids
        to work day to help share emotions with colleagues during these
        difficult times (Belgium, 2020).

      <p>
        Working from home allows for more flexibility and better health and
        morale. If proper work life balance can be maintained, it can provide
        flexibility in the work day allowing workers to exercise at a time that
        works best for them, cook lunches that are healthier, and save money
        from the lack of commuting and reduction in spend on expensive business
        attire (Shukla, 2020).

      <p>
        Some studies report telecommuting reduced stress by as much as 82%.
        There are a few factors why home-based employment is less stressful than
        traditional office jobs, such as no daily commute, greater control over
        work environment, and improved work-life balance (Anderson, 2019).

      <p>
        If 52% of the US workforce works at home for one day a week, we will
        save 20 million tons of C02 which is equal to 4.3 million passenger cars
        not driven in one year. This reduction in the earthâ€™s carbon footprint
        may reverse some respiratory problems experienced such as asthma and
        allergies (Castelluccio, 2020).
