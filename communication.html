        The COVID-19 impact on the remote worker’s communication and
        collaboration

        Working from home raises the importance of the companies’ ability to
        communicate and engage with their employees. Clear guidelines and
        in-depth clarification of responsibilities are required to deal with the
        new ways of working and retain employee engagement (Loten, 2020).

      <h1>Effective Communication</h1>

      />
      <p>
        Communication should be much more frequent as we are working remotely.
        If someone asks a question in person, you answer it immediately. If
        someone asks a question over email or text, there should be an immediate
        or quick response, so it simulates the same concept as in person.
        Effective communication such as these suggestions, increases engagement
        and productivity (Belgium, 2020).

    <div class="employee_trust">
      <h1>Employee Trust</h1>
      <img

        alt="employee_trust_chart"
      />
      <p>
        Remote workers feel like they are part of the team and organization, and
        thus feel greater trust in you as their manager. Each of these elements
        relates to engagement and helps boost performance and productivity as
        well. To build trust within remote workers during COVID-19, managers
        must communicate what is expected of them in terms of performance level,
        project prioritization, and the volume of work expected. Moreover,
        managers must make sure remote workers have what they need and provide
        positive feedback (Madell, 2020).

    <div class="collaboration">
      <h1>Collaboration</h1>
      <img

        class="left"
      />
      <p>
        Since our main communication is not face-to-face, often times there will
        be many misinterpretations employees have to deal with which may cause
        frustration and annoyance. Employees may often feel disconnected with
        their peers and lack collaboration. Collaboration tools such as Slack
        and Trello can improve morale, productivity, focus, and communication.
        Tools such as these, can decrease feelings of loneliness and isolation
        while working from home, so remote workers can instantly collaborate
        with their colleagues leading to a more productive workday (Hanson,
        2020).
