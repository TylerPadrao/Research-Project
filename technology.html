        As many workers scramble to work from home, the hardware companies have
        seen a major demand for laptops and mobile devices to support employees
        working at home. The supply of electronic devices has become scarce.
        Factories in Asia are struggling to open at full capacity and the
        shortage of raw materials has caused a disruption to the electronics
        value chain which has decreased the availability of products and
        continues to increase product prices (Deloitte, 2020).

        Security software will see a benefit from a growing remote workforce.
        Companies now have to manage and organize everything remotely across
        many different networks and ascertain a secure infrastructure for remote
        working. As cybercrime increased since the pandemic, in depth security
        structural changes are required to protect the work remotely (Belgium,
        2020).

      <p>
        Technology has played a huge role in communication remotely. Companies
        think they have the tools to work remotely. However, there is a lack of
        communication tools and training of how employees should navigate remote
        work situations. The increase use of teleconferencing software such as
        instant messaging tools, project management tools, time tracking tools,
        and video conferencing are all good technologies for a remote worker to
        take advantage. These tools will all assist with a productive work
        environment (Shukla, 2020).

      <p>
        An average US employee that works from home spends 5 hours a week
        dealing with technology problems. This advised employers to strengthen
        their technology. Employers need to implement remote working in a
        structural way; without the correct tools and structure to implement
        remote working, there is a risk of loss of efficiency and frustration
        with employees and stakeholders (Loten, 2020).
